The new Date() constructor in the code snippet (Q1) creates a new Date object representing the current date and time. (Answer 1)

When currentDate.toDateString() is executed, it will log the current date in the format "Day Month Date Year." For example, it might log something like "Tue Oct 18 2023." (Answer 2)

To log the current date and time, you can use the toString() method instead of toDateString(). Here's the modified code:

```
const currentDate = new Date();
console.log(currentDate.toString());

```

(Answer 3)

To display the current date and time in a different format, you can use various methods like toLocaleString(), toLocaleDateString(), or toLocaleTimeString() with appropriate options and locales to customize the format. (Answer 4)

The toDateString() method formats a Date object as "Day Month Date Year" in the English language, whereas toLocaleDateString() allows you to format the date according to the user's locale and preferences. (Answer 5)

To create a Date object for a specific date, you can specify the year, month (0-indexed), and day as follows:

```
const specificDate = new Date(2023, 11, 25); // December 25, 2023

```

(Answer 6)

You can extract the current year from the currentDate object in the code snippet (Q1) using the getFullYear() method:

```
const currentYear = currentDate.getFullYear();

```

(Answer 7)

The getDay() method returns the day of the week as a number (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.), while getDate() returns the day of the month as a number (1-31). (Answer 8)

To find the number of days between two specific dates, you can create Date objects for the two dates and then calculate the difference in milliseconds. Here's an example:

```
const date1 = new Date('2023-01-01');
const date2 = new Date('2023-12-31');
const timeDifference = Math.abs(date2 - date1);
const daysDifference = Math.ceil(timeDifference / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));

```

(Answer 9)

You can set the Date and Time to a specific value using JavaScript's Date object by providing the year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. Here's an example:

```const specificDateTime = new Date(2023, 11, 25, 12, 0, 0, 0); // December 25, 2023, 12:00:00 PM

```
