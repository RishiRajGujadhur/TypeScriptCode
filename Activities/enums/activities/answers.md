Answer 1:
An enum in TypeScript is a way to define a set of named numeric constants. It allows you to create a list of predefined values, making code more readable and self-documenting.

Answer 2:
The numeric value of the Green color in the "Color" enum is 1. (Enums start with a value of 0 by default, and each subsequent value is incremented by 1.)

Answer 3:
The value of "Color.Red" is the string "Red."

Answer 4:
The numeric value of "DaysOfWeek.Friday" in the enum would be 5, assuming Sunday is assigned the value 0.

Answer 5:
Enums provide benefits such as improved code readability and self-documentation, type checking, and prevention of magic numbers in code. You would choose to use enums when you have a set of related, constant values that need to be represented in a more structured and meaningful way.
