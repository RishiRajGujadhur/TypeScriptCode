Question 3: Explain the difference between let, const, and var for variable declaration.

Answer:

var has function scope, which means it's accessible throughout the function.
let and const have block scope, and const is used for variables that won't be reassigned.

Question 7: What is the difference between "null" and "undefined" in JavaScript?

Answer:

null represents an intentional absence of any object value.
undefined represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.

Question 8: How does the "this" keyword work in JavaScript?

Answer: The this keyword refers to the current object in which a function is being executed. Its value depends on how a function is called: in the global scope, this refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser); within an object method, this refers to the object itself.

Question 10: Explain the concept of "callback functions" and provide an example of their use.

Answer: A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after that function has completed. Callbacks are often used for asynchronous operations. Example:

```function fetchData(callback) {
  // Simulating an async operation
  setTimeout(function() {
    const data = 'Some data';
    callback(data);
  }, 1000);
}

function processData(data) {
  console.log('Processed data:', data);
}

fetchData(processData);
```

Question 10: What is an "arrow function" in JavaScript, and how does it differ from regular functions?

An arrow function is a concise way to write functions in JavaScript introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).

Arrow functions have a shorter syntax and lexically bind the this value, meaning they inherit this from their surrounding code, unlike regular functions, which have their own this context.

Question 11: What are "promises" in JavaScript, and how do they work?

Promises are a pattern for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may not be available yet but will be at some point in the future. Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.

They are used to handle asynchronous tasks like network requests and file operations, making it easier to manage asynchronous code flow.

Question 12: What is "asynchronous programming," and how is it achieved in JavaScript?

Asynchronous programming is a way of writing code that doesn't block the execution of other tasks while waiting for a time-consuming operation to complete. In JavaScript, asynchronous programming is achieved using callbacks, promises, async/await, and event listeners. It allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for potentially time-consuming operations to finish.

Question 14: Explain the difference between "null" and "undefined."

null represents the intentional absence of any object value or a variable with no value assigned. It is an explicit assignment by a programmer. undefined, on the other hand, indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet. It is the default value for uninitialized variables.

Question 15: What is the "DOM" in the context of web development and JavaScript?

The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the page, such as elements and their attributes. JavaScript can interact with and manipulate the DOM to dynamically update the content and structure of web pages.

Question 16: How do you handle errors in JavaScript, and what are the types of errors you might encounter?

Errors in JavaScript can be handled using try...catch blocks. There are various types of errors, including syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors. Common built-in error objects in JavaScript include Error, SyntaxError, TypeError, and ReferenceError.

Question 17: Explain the use of "JSON" in JavaScript and how you can parse and stringify JSON data.

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format. In JavaScript, you can parse JSON data using JSON.parse() to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object and stringify JavaScript objects into JSON format using JSON.stringify().
