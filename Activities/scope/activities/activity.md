1. Global Variable Task:

Define a global variable myGlobalVar and set it to 42. Then, create a function printGlobalVar that prints the value of myGlobalVar.

2. Local Variable Task:

Create a function called calculateAverage that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and calculates their average. Ensure that any variables used for calculations are declared locally within the function.

3. Variable Shadowing Task:

Write a function called multiply that takes two parameters, x and y. Inside the function, declare a local variable result. Multiply x and y and assign the result to result. Return result from the function. Ensure that the local variable result doesn't interfere with any global variables.

4. Parameter vs. Global Variable Task:

Create a function called greetUser that takes a parameter name and prints a greeting message like "Hello, [name]!" using the name parameter. Make sure not to use any global variables for the name.

5. Nested Scope Task:

Create a nested function called outer that declares a variable outerVar. Inside outer, define another function called inner that prints the value of outerVar. Call outer to test if the inner function can access outerVar.

6. Block Scope Task:

Write a function called printNumbers that uses a loop to print numbers from 1 to 5. Declare any variables needed inside the function with let to ensure they have block scope.
